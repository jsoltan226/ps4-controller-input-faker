; The runtime configuration file for the PS4 Controller input faker daemon
;
; If any of the below values are unset or invalid, the default (marked with `DEFAULT: ...`)
; will be used by the program.

; The EV_KEY code that will be sent to the fake keyboard when an event from the ps4 controller is reported
;
; It's recommended to pick a key code that is unlikely to ever be used by any application,
; hence the default is `KEY_F21` (which you probably didn't even know existed lol).
;
; For valid values (`KEY_*`) see the `linux/input-event-codes.h` in the linux kernel headers
; (usually `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h` on systems with the linux-headers package installed)
;
; DEFAULT: KEY_F21
fake_keypress_keycode = KEY_F21

; The logging verbosity of the program.
; For possible values see `core/log.h` in the program source.
;
; Note that in release builds, `LOG_DEBUG` is disabled regardless of this setting.
;
; DEFAULT: LOG_INFO
log_level = LOG_INFO
